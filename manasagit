BRANCHES:
It's an individual process of development for code.
we create individual branch in real-time to do test and developed.
each developer will work on their own branch.
At the end we will merge all branches into actual branch.
Default branch is Master.

git branch          : to list the branches
git branch dev                 : to create a new branch
git checkout dev         : to switch from one branch to another.
git checkout -b dev             : to create and switch from one branch to another.
git branch -m oldname newname : to rename a branch
git branch -D dev         : to delete a branch
